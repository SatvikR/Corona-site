# Corona-site
Coronavirus-tracker website

The actual data grabbing script is from my other repo. Check it out here: https://github.com/SatvikR/Coronavirus-visualization-python

All the raw data is from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

This website is made with a flask backend and HTML/JS front-end.

I use d3.js for the graph
