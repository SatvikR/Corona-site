Coronavirus-tracker website

The actual data grabbing is from a different repo I made. Check it out here: https://github.com/SatvikR/Coronavirus-visualization-python

All the data is from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

I will publish this to a domain soon, right now, you can download it for yourself and run it locally.
