# Corona-site
Coronavirus-tracker website

The URL is http://satvikreddy.com/

The actual data grabbing script is from my other repo. Check it out here: https://github.com/SatvikR/Coronavirus-visualization-python

All the raw data is from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

This website is made with a flask (python) backend and HTML/JS front-end.

I use d3.js for the graph

Latest Addition:
    
    - For easier usability, I added a dynamic dropdown list
